# FlowSchema and API access limitation is required because cilium agent pods can simultaneously make
# lots of cluster-scoped list requests. These requests become preflight in clusters with many pods and hit etcd.
# It leads to the growth of memory consumed by both etcd and kube-apiserver and can cause OOMKills.
